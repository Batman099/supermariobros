        <h3> Luigi </h3>
    <p>Luigi is Mario’s slightly younger, taller fraternal twin brother and the deuteragonist of the Mario franchise. Throughout his life, he has lived in Mario’s shadow, developing both cowardly and heroic tendencies. Despite this, Luigi has helped and fought alongside his brother on many occasions. Mario Bros. marks his first appearance in the Mario franchise and his debut in general. Originally an exact copy, then palette swap of Mario, Luigi was created to facilitate a second-player option. Since the two-player mode was dropped from most main Super Mario games beginning with Super Mario Land, Luigi has gained his own identity and personality, becoming a co-starring character of the Mario franchise. This is especially noticeable in installments for the Luigi’s Mansion and the Mario & Luigi series of games. Luigi’s notable traits include his green cap, his smooth mustache, his cowardly personality, his Italian accent, his heavy use of power-ups, and a superior jumping ability to Mario.</p>

    <h4> Yoshi </h4>
<p>Yoshi is a dinosaur-like character that acts as an ally of Mario and Luigi and is the protagonist of his own franchise. Among members of the Yoshi species hailing from Yoshi’s Island, any Yoshi may be identified as the “Yoshi” character, and as such, not all iterations of the character are necessarily the same one. According to the Super Mario World manual, he got his name from Yoshi’s Island because he was first discovered there.[1] In the Super Mario series, he often acts as a rideable character for the heroes, while in most of the spin-off games, he is a playable character on his own. Yoshi’s defining traits include his cutesy appearance, his cheerful and friendly personality, his flutter-jumping and egg-laying abilities, his rideability as a steed, and exclaiming his own name</p>

The series began with the release of Super Mario Bros. on September 13, 1985, and has since spanned over twenty games appearing on every major Nintendo video game console.

The anniversary was announced in a Nintendo Direct on September 3, 2020, and ran until March 31, 2021.</p>
